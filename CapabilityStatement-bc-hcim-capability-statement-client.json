When the Client Registry determines that a change to a Patient has occurred, it will notify all clients that have subscribed to changes of that specific type.</p><p>The outgoing response to the Subscription is a Bundle. The Bundle has two entries: One with MetadataParamtersIn for messageId, messageDate and sender, one for a ClientRegistryPatient (profile of Patient). The following table describes the request and the four parameters; all are mandatory. The Client Registry SHALL use the following IN parameters when sending a change notification.</p><table class=\"grid\"><tr><td><b>Use</b></td><td><b>Name</b></td><td><b>Cardinality</b></td><td><b>Type</b></td><td><b>Binding</b></td><td><b>Documentation</b></td></tr><tr><td>IN</td><td>ReviseRequestBundle</td><td>1..1</td><td><a href=\"StructureDefinition-bc-revise-request-bundle.html\">ReviseRequestBundle</a></td><td/><td><div><p>A Bundle with the Patient change.</p></div></td></tr><tr><td>OUT</td><td/><td/><td/><td/><td>Out is a 200 HTTP response code indicating the subscription response was recieved.</td></tr></table></div>"
