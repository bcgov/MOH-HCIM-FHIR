# Client Registry Overview

The Client Registry is the authoritative registry of health care client demographics information in British Columbia.  The purpose of the Provincial Client Registry is to: 
- assign a Personal Health Number (PHN) for all receivers of healthcare services; 
- maintain client demographic information (e.g., name, address, contact) in relation to those 
PHNs; and
- collect and link identity information about clients who have received a healthcare service across the BC health sector.

Authorized users with a point of service application integrated with the Client Registry can: 
- search for and capture patient identity information to support safe health care service delivery; 
- store client demographics from the Client Registry in the point of service application; 
- update client demographic information in the Client Registry; and 
- create PHNs for patients. 

Client Registry currently has a HL7 V3 implementation and this guide describes the HL7 FHIR implementation.

See British Columbia's [Health Information Exchange](https://www2.gov.bc.ca/gov/content/health/practitioner-professional-resources/software) for more for details on the Client Registry system and access to Client Registry.
