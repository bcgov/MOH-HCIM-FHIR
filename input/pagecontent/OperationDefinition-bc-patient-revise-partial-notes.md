The response is a Bundle and the entries hold the: 
* input parameters echoed back in a Parameters resource, 
* the matched patients in a Patients resource and 
* an OperationOutcome resource with any errors or warnings.

The response will include the full Patient and metadata name-value pairs.  See [this page](StructureDefinition-bc-partial-revise-response-bundle.html) for more details on the response.  The response is essentially the same as a Revise Person response.
