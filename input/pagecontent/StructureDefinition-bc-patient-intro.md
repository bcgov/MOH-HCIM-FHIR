Patient is a core resource of the Client Registry FHIR implementation.  Patients are returned by queries ([Find Candidates](OperationDefinition-bc-patient-find-candidates.html) and [Get Demographics](OperationDefinition-bc-patient-get-demographics.html)) and modifed or updated by [revise](OperationDefinition-bc-patient-revise.html) and [merge](OperationDefinition-bc-patient-merge.html) operations. This profile primarily adds extensions to elements that the core Patient resource does not include such as business dates.
