><span style="color:red">Note</span><br>This specification is currently published as a Draft Standard on the ministry GitHub and is not intended for implementation. Feedback is welcome but readers should understand that there is more work to be done in testing the profiles and operations defined in this guide. For more information, please see the Future Plans page in this guide.

### Future Plans

This guide still needs to undergo review and testing by the Ministry and stakeholders.

* Review by BC Health Information Standards Working Group
* Finalize the alignment to the Canadian Core and BC Core FHIR profiles
* Testing of the guides operations and profiles to ensure proper coverage
* Publication to BC's FHIR Portal

Although this guide is complete the implementation of the new FHIR Operations will be done in stages.  Priority to the most desired services, as indicated by Client Registry stakeholders, will be implemented first.  Currently the search services are highest priority and will be completed first.
