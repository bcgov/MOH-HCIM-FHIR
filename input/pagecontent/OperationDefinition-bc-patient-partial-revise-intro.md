><span style="color:red">Note</span><br>This specification is currently published as a Draft Standard on the ministry GitHub and is not intended for implementation. Feedback is welcome but readers should understand that there is more work to be done in testing the profiles and operations defined in this guide. For more information, please see the Future Plans page in this guide.

The Partial Revise Operation can be used to partially update a Patient record.  The standard IN parameters are required, see below, including a SRI.  The parameter that is used for the partial update is patchOperation which is a Parameters resource.  These Parameters should be populated following the [RESTful Patch description](https://www.hl7.org/fhir/http.html#patch).
