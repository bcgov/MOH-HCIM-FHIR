The Get Demographics query is a FHIR Operation.

The request is a Bundle with Resources for search parameters and a Patient, i.e. [ClientRegistryClient](StructureDefinition-bc-patient.html), to match against.  The Patient resource must have an identifier for this search to succeed.  
Please refer also to the [Identifiers](identifiers.html) page to find more details regarding how to use Identifier in your query.
